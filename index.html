      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        My name is James Kiprop Koech. I am a Fullstack Software Development
        student at GOMYCODE Kenya and a tech enthusiast.<br />
        I'm fascinated with how AI has made significant progress over the past
        two decades and this made me want to be part<br />
        of the AI revolution and not just to witness it. I am also interested
        with exploring the broadness of the <br />
        tech ecosystem and the vital role that it plays in shaping the
        future.<br />
